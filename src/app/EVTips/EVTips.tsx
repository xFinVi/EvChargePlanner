      Switching to electric vehicles can transform your operations,
    </h3>
    <p className="mb-6 text-center text-gray-600">
      but it’s worth considering the full picture. Here are key advantages and a
      challenge to weigh up:
    </p>
    <ul className="flex flex-col gap-6 mt-4 text-gray-600 list-disc list-inside">
      <li>
        <strong>Cost Savings Over Time:</strong> EVs cut fuel and maintenance
        costs significantly—fewer moving parts mean less wear and tear,
        potentially saving thousands annually.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tax Benefits & Incentives:</strong> Take advantage of UK grants
        and tax breaks, like the Plug-in Van Grant or reduced Benefit-in-Kind
        rates, to offset initial costs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Future-Proof & Sustainable Growth:</strong> With upcoming
        regulations favoring EV adoption, businesses that transition early will
        gain a competitive edge and align with sustainability goals.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Warranty Protection:</strong> Most EV manufacturers offer up to
        10 years of battery warranty, with replacements if health drops below
        70% threshold within warranty.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Environmental Edge:</strong> Reduce your carbon footprint and
        meet sustainability targets, positioning your business as a leader in a
        greener future.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Charging Infrastructure Challenge:</strong> Plan for adequate
        charging stations—limited access or slow installation could disrupt
        operations, especially for larger fleets.
      </li>
    </ul>
