      Why Your Business Should Consider Transitioning to an EV Fleet
    </h3>
    <ul className="list-disc flex flex-col gap-6 list-inside mt-4 text-gray-600">
      <li><strong>Lower Operating Costs:</strong> EVs have fewer moving parts, meaning significantly reduced maintenance and fuel expensesâ€”saving your business thousands annually.</li>
      <li><strong>Government Incentives & Tax Breaks:</strong> The UK offers grants, tax relief, and subsidies, making the switch financially attractive while lowering upfront costs.</li>
      <li><strong>Future-Proof & Sustainable Growth:</strong> With upcoming regulations favoring EV adoption, businesses that transition early will gain a competitive edge and align with sustainability goals.</li>
      <li><strong>Warranty Protection:</strong> Most EV manufacturers offer up to 10 years of battery warranty, with replacements if health drops below 70% threshold within warranty.</li>
    </ul>
